Coding Quiz Challenge

This is a web application that presents the user with a timed quiz consisting of multiple-choice questions related to coding. The user must answer the questions within the given time limit, and incorrect answers will penalize their score and time by ten seconds. The final score is calculated based on the number of correct answers.

Usage

When the application is launched, the user is presented with a start screen containing a brief introduction to the quiz and a "Start Quiz" button. Clicking on this button starts the quiz and presents the user with the first question.

Each question consists of a question title and a set of multiple-choice answers. The user must select one of the answers to proceed to the next question. If the user selects the correct answer, their score is incremented and they are presented with the next question. If the user selects an incorrect answer, their score is decremented and their time is reduced by ten seconds.

When the user has answered all of the questions or the time runs out, the quiz ends and the user is presented with a final score and a form to enter their initials. After entering their initials and submitting the form, the user is taken to a high scores screen where they can view their score and the scores of other users.
